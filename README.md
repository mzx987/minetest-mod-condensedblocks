# Condensed Blocks

*All code is under the zlib License.*

*Textures are not under any license. Do what you want with them.*

This mod adds condensed blocks. They can be condensed up to 4 times (I would like to add a config option for this to allow condensing blocks up to 8x).

Currently, it only supports most of the solid blocks in the default modpack that Minetest comes with. If you want support for other modded blocks, please let me know. I will add it, or possibly work on some kind of API.
